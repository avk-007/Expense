Service Interface and Implementation
Interface:

java
public interface ExpenseService {
    ExpenseResponseDTO createExpense(ExpenseRequestDTO dto);
}
This defines a contract for your service: any class implementing ExpenseService must provide a createExpense method that takes a request DTO and returns a response DTO. This promotes clean, modular code and makes testing/mocking easier.

Implementation:

java
@Override
public ExpenseResponseDTO createExpense(ExpenseRequestDTO dto) {
    Expense expense = new Expense();
    BeanUtils.copyProperties(dto, expense);
    Expense saved = expenseRepository.save(expense);
    return mapToDTO(saved);
}
Let’s step through what happens here:

1. Creating the Entity
java
Expense expense = new Expense();
An entity is created. This is typically a JPA/Hibernate object mapping to a database table.

2. Copying Properties from DTO to Entity
java
BeanUtils.copyProperties(dto, expense);
All matching fields from the Data Transfer Object (DTO) are copied into the entity object.

DTOs are used for receiving/sending data without exposing entity details directly in your REST API.

This method quickly moves data from the API object to the persistence object.

3. Persisting to the Database
java
Expense saved = expenseRepository.save(expense);
The entity is saved to the database using a Spring Data JPA repository. This handles the SQL behind the scenes.

4. Mapping Entity Back to a DTO
java
return mapToDTO(saved);
The saved entity (which might have new fields, like generated IDs) is converted back into a DTO, which is returned to the API caller.

This ensures you have control over exactly what you expose in your API response.

The Art of Writing APIs in Spring Boot
Here are some key concepts and steps for creating APIs like this:

1. Model-DTO Separation
Model/Entity: Represents the database structure.

DTO: Represents the REST API contract (what the frontend/app sends or receives).

Keeps your API flexible—changing DB structure doesn't directly impact your clients.

2. Service Layer
Contains business logic and orchestrates calls between repositories and other components.

Exposes only what is needed for controllers or other consumers.

3. Repository Layer
Handles database interactions. With Spring Data JPA, you usually just define an interface!

4. Controller Layer (API Endpoints)
Typically, you'd have:

java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/expenses")
public class ExpenseController {
    @Autowired
    private ExpenseService expenseService;

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<ExpenseResponseDTO> create(@RequestBody ExpenseRequestDTO dto) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok(expenseService.createExpense(dto));
    }
}
This connects the API endpoint (/api/expenses) to your service method.

Best Practices
Validation: Use annotations like @Valid and @NotNull for incoming DTOs.

Exception Handling: Write exception handlers to return meaningful error responses.

Separation of Concerns: Keep controller, service, repository, and entity logic cleanly separated.

Testing: Mock service/repo layers for unit testing.

Summary Table
Layer	-->Responsibility
Controller--	Handles HTTP requests/responses.
Service	--Contains business logic, coordinates operations.
Repository--	Handles database access (CRUD operations).
DTO	--Contract for API, shields entity details.
Entity	--Maps to database tables for persistence.
